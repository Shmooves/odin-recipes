<p>Baking salmon in a foil packet it a very healthy way of preparing fish, because you don't need to use any fat for the baking process. I season the salmon with an exotic mix of marjoram, lemon, and star anise, but you could use the same method with different herbs and spices.</p>
<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<p><ul>
    <li>olive oil</li>
    <li>2 medium onions</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon dried marjoram</li>
    <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>2 lemons</li>
    <li>5 pods whole star anise pods</li>
    <li>1/3 cup water</li>
    <li>aluminum foil</li>
    <li>1(1 1/2-pound)salmon fillet</li>
</ul></p>
<h4>Steps</h4>
<p><ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C)</li>
    <li>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat and cook onions until soft and browned, about 10 minutes. Season with marjoram and a little salt. Remove from heat.</li>
    <li>Place lemon slices in a single layer in a clean skillet over high heat and cook until lightly browned on both sides, about 3 minutes. Add star anise and water and bring to a boil. Remove from heat.</li>
    <li>Cover a baking pan large enough to hold the salmon with sheets of aluminum foil, leaving an overhang on all sides. Lay onions in a single layer on the bottom; place salmon fillet on top, skin-side down. Rub fillet with salt and pepper. Cover with lemon slices and star anise. Fold up the edges of the foil over the salmon to create a packet, making sure to seal the edges well.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until salmon flakes easily with a fork, 35 to 40 minutes. Remove from oven, open foil carefully, and serve.</li>
